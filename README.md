LiDAR technology plays a vital role in capturing the economic importance of forest and
in policy making through monitoring forests and agricultural resources remotely. It is a
prominent remote sensing technology to capture 3-D forest structure with spatial and temporal
meta-data such as coordinates, colors, GPS locations, and timestamps. This project
aims to use LiDAR data to recreate forest structure in 3-Dimensions to perform forest
inventory analysis and object characterizations. This study also presents an automated
pipeline of methodologies to identify individual trees from forest vegetation and estimate
tree characteristics such as canopy heights and trunk diameter. The derived forest structure
is used as an arena to simulate animal movements using Deep Q Reinforcement Learning in
2-Dimensions. Bats are chosen as the model group as they are sensitive to the density of
vegetation. This paper proposes a work
ow for any species of bat to take appropriate action
depending on the environment by evaluating the rewards for each available action. This
paper also describes a simulation-based investigation of the behavior of the movements in a
controlled environment to evaluate decision-making strategies, the performance of collision
avoidance, and the success rate of traveling across the forest.
